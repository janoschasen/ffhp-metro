FFHP-Metro Design-Template for WordPress

Fully customized Front-Page Theme for Wordpress. Adding a shiny Tile-Design to your Worpress-Blog / Website.
The theme was developed for +Peter Haase Consulting+ http://www.peterhaase.de and can also be seen (in dev-state) on http://janoschasen.de/ffhp-wp-metro/

The most tiles get their label from wordress-post-titles and display the post on the bigger state after click.
The slider-tiles use a jqeury-cycle slider to either get posts or images from wordpress-categories and display them styled in different ways.
There are also some neat plugins added in such as:
# 2-click-socialmedia-buttons: adding a certain increase of data-security for the viewer and decreasing the initial loading-times
# ajax-contact: a small form plugin allowing a refresh free contact form to be included. Made style-adjustments in the plugin-css to fit the style of the theme
# oauth-twitter-feed-for-developers: wich i didn't customize but i customized the output on the page (not implemented in the plugin itself)
# rss-shortcode: getting a rss-/atom-feed to the page. I made some design and code adjustments here.

The theme was developed on WP3.5 but should be working downwards perfectly at leadt with the 3-ish versions as it's not using to much fancy php-stuff or newer jquery functions.
